       "[\"The first film in the re-imagining of the series was a big hit, but this sequel was a global success, especially with the superb performance by the star of Brokeback Mountain who tragically died from a (prescribed) drugs overdose shortly after filming had finished, from director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia). Basically a criminal terrorist and mastermind calling himself the Joker (posthumous Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Heath Ledger) robs the bank run by the mob, and to take on the Mafia district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) becomes the new face for justice and hope in Gotham City, with the help of Batman aka Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Lieutenant James 'Jim' Gordon (Gary Oldman). Mob bosses Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts), Gambol (Michael Jai White) and the Chechen (Ritchie Coaster), who have had Chinese accountant Lau (Chin Han) hide their funds, are confronted by the Joker because he wants to kill the, but they all refuse to help, putting a bounty on him. The Joker kills Gambol, and his gang go under his control, and meanwhile Batman, with new technology supplied by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), has found and returned Lau to Gotham to testify in a court case to help bring down the gangsters. The Joker puts his plan into action by threatening the city, if the Dark Knight does not reveal his true identity he will kill people, and soon enough he starts killing the people involved in the mob boss court cases, including Commissioner Loeb (The Fast Show's Colin McFarlane) and Judge Surrillo (Nydia Rodriguez Terracina), and Dent may be next. Dent is hidden, and Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has been dating Dent is being looked after by Bruce's faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sir Michael Caine), but the Joker appears to kill Gordon, who sacrifices himself to save the Mayor (Nestor Carbonell), and when Bruce plans to reveal his identity to the press Dent claims he is the Batman. This means that the district attorney is taken into protective custody, but the Joker catches up and tries to kill him, but Batman inside his armoured car and then on his motorcycle is on their tail, and Gordon who faked his death catches the criminals, and gets promoted to Commissioner. Batman demands to know from the clown prince of crime where Dent and Rachel are, as they have disappeared, and eventually, after some beating, he reveals that they are both in separate buildings full of explosives, Batman planned to find Rachel, but he instead gets to Dent, so Rachel is blown up and dies, while Dent is taken out, but petrol on half his face ignites when the explosion happens. Using documents, Wayne Enterprises accountant Mike Engel (Anthony Michael Hall) has concluded that Bruce Wayne is Batman, so he plans blackmail, and meanwhile the Joker has escaped prison and kills Lau and the Chechen, and he threatens to bomb a hospital if Reese isn't killed. While the accountant is rescued by Gordon, the Joker visits Dent in hospital, who has become scarred on half his face and donned the persona of Two-Face, he tells him that the mob is responsible for the death of Rachel and convinces him to get revenge, on a coin flip decision. Gotham General Hospital was blown up, while Two-Face manages to find and kill Maroni and two corrupt cops who helped kidnap Rachel, and the Joker has rigged two ships, one carrying civilian passengers and the other Arkham Asylum inmates, with explosives, and both sets of people have the trigger for the opposite ship, with the demand to blow up the other ship before midnight, or both be exploded. With the help of Fox and a computer as a citywide tracking device, they manage to find where the Joker is, in a building, where hostages are wearing clown masks to look like criminals to the SWAT, but they are saved, both ships refuse to blow up each other, and the Joker despite being caught boasts that he has won when Dent's rampage will be revealed. Gordon is lured to the building where Rachel died where his wife and children are being held hostage, and Dent is threatening their lives from the flip of his coin, and after being shot while wearing body armour Batman tackles Dent, causing him to fall from the top of the building to the ground, and saving Gordon's son. So that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for Gotham City, Batman wants to take responsibility for the deaths of the people Dent murdered, Gordon is upset but is forced to agree, so he orders a manhunt for Batman, while Alfred spares Bruce anymore heartache by burning a letter that Rachel wrote announcing her engagement to Harvey, and Fox sees the tracking computer self-destruct. Also starring Monique Gabriela Curnen as Ramirez, Ron Dean as Wuertz, Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow aka Dr. Jonathan Crane, William Fichtner as Bank Manager and The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as Tattooed Prisoner. Bale is still fantastic as the silly playboy and the rough and ready dark hero, Ledger is fascinating as the psychopathic and intelligent scar-faced villain (the licking of lips is a great psycho touch), Eckhart is alright as the slowly maddened political figure turned Two-Face, and the other cast members are good too. Just with the previous film the story is much more grown up and sophisticated compared to the previous incarnations, the make-up is good, and of course the explosions and special effects used create many more exciting chase and fight sequences, a cool and entertaining action fantasy. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair, Best Music for Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!\",\n",
       " 'Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.\"The Dark Knight\" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from \"Prison Break\", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, \"The Dark Knight\" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb\\'s Rating; but \"sometimes the truth is not good enough\". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"O Cavaleiro das Trevas\" (\"The Dark Knight\")',\n",
       " 'As I type this, \"Inception\" is sitting at #6 on IMDb\\'s Top 250 and has a firm 9 out of 10 voting average. That is unheard of. Not to say it is not a great film, but I am a little shocked by this. I give it an 8...Long story short, Christopher Nolan is a genius. He has a ton of films on the top 250 list, and still has along career ahead of him. This film was both written and directed by him, and the story and visuals are striking. Some of the story I think is a bit iffy (if you are too critical it might have major holes) but if you are accepting its basic premise, it is a solid concept that has not been explored before.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, and Leo is always a good lead. The family issues here tread close to where \"Shutter Island\" tread, but this only shows where that other film fell short (as much as I enjoyed both).Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, and was for me the most pleasant surprise of the film. I still have a hard time accepting him as a legitimate actor and not just a cheesy, comedic character. But here I was moved. He did his own stunts during what was by far my favorite scene of the film, and although he still looks twenty (he was 29 at the time this film came out) he has lots of potential.Ellen Page was a decent Ariadne (her most adult role yet), and it was nice to see Nolan veterans Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine back for more. And a special shout-out to Pete Postlethwaite (Maurice Fischer) in what was one of his very final roles.Anyway, a must-see if ever there was one in the last few years. 9 out of 10? Maybe. 6th greatest film ever? I don\\'t know... but definitely one of those rare gems of the last decade.',\n",
       " \"This is a world where people can go into your dreams. Some are even able to use your dreams to influence your actions. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is skilled at stealing secrets by diving into your dreams. It's a dark treacherous world where he has made too many enemies. Now he is offered a chance to come in from the cold. This time his team is tasked to plant an idea into the target's mind, or in one word inception.Christopher Nolan has created something of a Penrose-stairs structure in this movie. It's complicated and may be too convoluted to be reasonable. But that's as much part of its charm. The worlds, the effects, the ideas are all first rate. It is oozing with originality.The actors are also first rate. Nolan can command the best cast to his projects now. There is nobody better than DiCaprio to anchor this movie. Nothing about this movie is done with lesser parts. This is indeed a top movie.\",\n",
       " 'I was able to see \"Parasite\" a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and many people there loved the film....as did my daughter who saw it with me. As for me, I think the production values were excellent but the ending changed my overall feelings about the movie. Up untl the end, I liked it very, very much....but after the ultra-violent climax, I was left a bit cold. Your experience with the film is really dependent on whether or not you can take the violence and how it impacts you.Instead of talking about the plot and how great or not the film is, I want to focus on the violence. My daughter felt the violence wasn\\'t that extreme and it was needed for the plot. As for me, seeing knives plunged into people at close range and seeing a giant rock smashed ultra-realistically into a person\\'s head just turned my stomach. There could be violence without it being THIS extreme and THIS personal and close-up.So, overall it\\'s still a good film but one I really wish I hadn\\'t seen.']"

For example, Cluster 0 seems to indicate word attributes based on the movie \"Heat\" starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Similar results are seen in Cluster 8, which seems to be focused on the movie \"The Machinist\" starring Christian Bale. On the flip side certain clusters don't look to good. Cluster 9 is one of these. It looks just like a random sampling of words.\n",

For example, Cluster 18 seems to focus in on the movie \"The Hunt for Red October\". We also do see some \"odd\" clusters that don't really provide key information. For example Cluster 14 is just a bunch of random words that define a movie in general.\n",

    "From the clustering runs that were performed (K=5, K=10, K-20), the higher K is the most preferred. As described in question 2, the values that were higher than 5 started to get closer to grouping the reivews by specific topics or even got close to the specific movie. This would provide a much richer analysis and be much easier to explain than the items in clusters that are 5 or less. With the k value at 5 we saw that the clusters didn't really have much meaning."
